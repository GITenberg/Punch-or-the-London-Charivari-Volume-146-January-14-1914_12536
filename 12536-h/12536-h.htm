    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>We hear that the CHANCELLOR has, while in North Africa, been
    making a close study of camels, with a view to ascertaining the
    nature of the last straw which breaks their backs.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is denied that Mr. LLOYD GEORGE, in order to give a
    practical demonstration of his belief in the disarmament idea,
    has given instructions that all precautions against attacks on
    him by Suffragettes are to be discontinued.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Balkan situation is considered to have undergone a
    change for the worse owing to the purchase by Turkey of the
    Dreadnought <i>Rio de Janeiro</i>. For ourselves we cannot
    subscribe to this view. Is it likely that the Turks, after
    paying over &pound;2,000,000 for her, will risk losing this
    valuable vessel in war?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>On the day of the marriage of the Teuton Coal-King's
    daughter to Lord REDESDALE's son last week there was snow on
    the ground. The Coal-King must have shown up very well against
    it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Sir REGINALD BRADE is to be the new permanent secretary at
    the War Office. Let's hope he has no connection with the firm
    of Gold Brade and Red Tape.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It has been discovered that members of a certain Eskimo
    tribe have an extra joint in their waists. The news has caused
    the greatest excitement among cannibal tribes all over the
    world, and it is expected that there will be a huge demand for
    these people. Where there are big families to feed the extra
    joint will be invaluable.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"OUR RESOLUTION IS TO GO FORWARD IN THE NEW YEAR."
    advertises the London General Omnibus Co. A capital idea, this.
    Vehicles which simply go backwards are never so
    satisfactory.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>After one-hundred-and-fifty-years' careful consideration the
    War Office has given permission to the Black Watch and the
    King's Royal Rifle Corps to bear on their regimental colours
    the honorary distinction "North America, 1763-64," in
    recognition of services rendered during the war against the Red
    Indians.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Not sixty people visited "La Gioconda" on one of the days
    after her return to Paris, when a charge of four shillings was
    made for admission, and, towards the end of the day, the smile
    is said to have worn a rather forced look.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Who are the best selling modern authors?" asks a
    contemporary. We do not like to mention names, but, as readers,
    we have been sold by several popular writers lately.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are not surprised that many persons are becoming rather
    disgusted with our little amateurish attempts at Winter.
    Thousands now go to Switzerland, and Sir ERNEST SHACKLETON is
    going even further afield. Meanwhile the Government does
    nothing to stem this emigration.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The boxing craze among the French continues. M. VEDRINES,
    the intrepid aviator, has taken it up and been practising on M.
    Roux's ears.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German CROWN PRINCE has become a member of the Danzig
    Cabinet Makers' Union. Later on he hopes to become a
    Chancellor-maker.</p>

    Chronicle</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Could frugality go further? At the golden wedding
    celebrations of a Southend couple, a packet of wedding cake was
    eaten which had been put away on their marriage day in
    1863.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A soap combine, with a nominal capital of &pound;35,000,000,
    is said to have been formed to exploit China; and the Mongols
    may yet cease to be a yellow race.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The latest tall story from America is to the effect that
    some burglars who broke into the Presbyterian church at
    Syracuse, New York, stole a parcel of sermons.</p>

    <h2>WHAT TO TELL AN EDITOR.</h2>

    <p>In view of <i>The Daily Mail's</i> praiseworthy efforts to
    instruct applicants for situations in the correct phrasing of
    letters to prospective employers, we propose to supply a
    similar long-felt want, and give a little advice as to the kind
    of letter it is desirable to enclose with contributions to
    periodicals.</p>

    <p>Begin your letter in a friendly vein, hoping the Editor and
    his people are pretty well. Remember also that Editors like to
    know something of the characters and histories of their
    contributors. So let your communication include a
    <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of your personal and literary
    career. Don't fall into the error of making your letter too
    concise.</p>

    <p>The following suggestions may serve to indicate some of the
    lines of thought that you might follow:&mdash;</p>

    <p>(1) State where you sent your first manuscript.</p>

    <p>(2) What you thought of it, and of the Editor who returned
    it.</p>

    <p>(3) Your height and chest measurement (an Editor likes to be
    on the safe side).</p>

    <p>(4) State who persuaded you to take up literature, and give
    height and chest measurement of same.</p>

    <p>(5) Give a short but optimistic description of your
    contribution, not to exceed in length the contribution
    itself.</p>

    <p>(6) State whether literary genius is rife in your family or
    has been rife at any time since 1066.</p>

    <p>(7) Give a list of journals to which you have already sent
    the enclosed contribution, and state your reasons for supposing
    that the Editors were misguided. Hint that perhaps, after all,
    their lack of enterprise was fortunate for the present
    recipient.</p>

    <p>(8) Mention your hobbies and the different appointments you
    have held since the age of twelve, with names and addresses of
    employers. Also give your reasons for remaining as long as you
    did in each situation.</p>

    <p>(9) State how long you have been a subscriber to the journal
    you are electing to honour, and whether you think it's worth
    the money. Point out any little improvements you consider
    desirable in its compilation, and mention other periodicals as
    perfect examples. Preface these remarks with some such phrase
    as this: "Pray don't think I want to teach you your business,
    but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>(10) Give full list (names and addresses) of friends who
    have promised to buy the paper if your contribution
    appears.</p>

    <p>(11) Give a brief outline, in faultless English, of your
    religious, political and police court convictions, your views
    on Mr. LLOYD GEORGE, and any ideas you may have about the Law
    of Copyright.</p>

    <p>Finally, enclose a stamped and addressed envelope for the
    return of your article.</p>

    <h2>THE SAME OLD STORY.</h2>

    <p>We stood in a circle round the parrot's cage and gazed with
    interest at its occupant. She (Evangeline) was balancing easily
    on one leg, while with the other leg and her beak she tried to
    peel a monkey-nut. There are some of us who hate to be watched
    at meals, particularly when dealing with the dessert, but
    Evangeline is not of our number.</p>

    <p>"There," said Mrs. Atherley, "isn't she a beauty?"</p>

    <p>I felt that, as the last to be introduced, I ought to say
    something.</p>

    <p>"What do you say to a parrot?" I whispered to Miss
    Atherley.</p>

    <p>"Have a banana," suggested Archie.</p>

    <p>"I believe you say, 'Scratch-a-poll,'" said Miss Atherley,
    "but I don't know why."</p>

    <p>"Isn't that rather dangerous? Suppose it retorted 'Scratch
    your own,' I shouldn't know a bit how to go on."</p>

    <p>"It can't talk," said Archie. "It's quite a baby&mdash;only
    seven months old. But it's no good showing it your watch; you
    must think of some other way of amusing it."</p>

    <p>"Break it to me, Archie. Have I been asked down solely to
    amuse the parrot, or did any of you others want to see me?"</p>

    <p>"Only the parrot," said Archie.</p>

    <p>Evangeline paid no attention to us. She continued to wrestle
    with the monkey-nut. I should say that she was a bird not
    easily amused.</p>

    <p>"Can't it really talk at all?" I asked Mrs. Atherley.</p>

    <p>"Not yet. You see, she's only just come over from South
    America, and isn't used to the climate yet."</p>

    <p>"Just the person you'd expect to talk a lot about the
    weather. I believe you've been had. Write a little note to the
    poulterers and ask if you can change it. You've got a bad one
    by mistake."</p>

    <p>"We got it as a bird," said Mrs. Atherley with dignity, "not
    as a gramophone."</p>

    <p>The next morning Evangeline was as silent as ever. Miss
    Atherley and I surveyed it after breakfast. It was still
    grappling with a monkey-nut, but no doubt a different one.</p>

    <p>"Isn't it <i>ever</i> going to talk?" I asked. "Really, I
    thought parrots were continually chatting."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but they have to be taught&mdash;just like you teach a
    baby."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure? I quite see that you have to teach them any
    special things you want them to say, but I thought they were
    all born with a few simple obvious remarks, like 'Poor Polly,'
    or&mdash;or 'Dash LLOYD GEORGE.'"</p>

    <p>"I don't think so," said Miss Atherley. "Not the green
    ones."</p>

    <p>At dinner that evening, Mr. Atherley being now with us, the
    question of Evangeline's education was seriously
    considered.</p>

    <p>"The only proper method," began Mr. Atherley&mdash;"By the
    way," he said, turning to me, "you don't know anything about
    parrots, do you?"</p>

    <p>"No," I said. "You can go on quite safely."</p>

    <p>"The only proper method of teaching a parrot&mdash;I got
    this from a man in the City this morning&mdash;is to give her a
    word at a time, and to go on repeating it over and over again
    until she's got hold of it."</p>

    <p>"And after that the parrot goes on repeating it over and
    over again until you've got sick of it," said Archie.</p>

    <p>"Then we shall have to be very careful what word we choose,"
    said Mrs. Atherley.</p>

    <p>"What is your favourite word?"</p>

    <p>"Well, really&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Animal, vegetable or mineral?" asked Archie.</p>

    <p>"This is quite impossible. Every word by itself seems so
    silly."</p>

    <p>"Not 'home' and 'mother,'" I said reproachfully.</p>

    <p>"You shall recite your little piece in the drawing-room
    afterwards," said Miss Atherley to me. "Think of something
    sensible now."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Atherley. "What's the latest word from
    London?"</p>

    <p>"Kikuyu."</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"I can't say it again," I protested.</p>

    <p>"If you can't even say it twice, it's no good for
    Evangeline."</p>

    <p>A thoughtful silence fell upon us.</p>

    <p>"Have you fixed on a name for her yet?" Miss Atherley asked
    her mother.</p>

    <p>"Evangeline, of course."</p>

    <p>"No, I mean a name for her to call <i>you</i>. Because if
    she's going to call you 'Auntie' or 'Darling,' or whatever you
    decide on, you'd better start by teaching her that."</p>

    <p>And then I had a brilliant idea.</p>

    <p>"I've got the very word," I said. "It's 'hallo.' You see,
    it's a pleasant form of greeting to any stranger, and it will
    go perfectly with the next word that she's taught, whatever it
    may be."</p>

    <p>"Supposing it's 'wardrobe,'" suggested Archie, "or
    'sardine'?"</p>

    <p>"Why not? 'Hallo, Sardine' is the perfect title for a
    <i>revue</i>. Witty, subtle, neat&mdash;probably the great
    brain of the Revue King has already evolved it, and is planning
    the opening scene."</p>

    <p>"Yes, 'hallo' isn't at all bad," said Mr. Atherley. "Anyway,
    it's better than 'Poor Polly,' which is simply morbid. Let's
    fix on 'hallo.'"</p>

    <p>"Good," said Mrs. Atherley.</p>

    <p>Evangeline said nothing, being asleep under her blanket.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I was down first next morning, having forgotten to wind up
    my watch overnight. Longing for company I took the blanket off
    Evangeline's cage and introduced her to the world again. She
    stirred sleepily, opened her eyes and blinked at me.</p>

    <p>"Hallo, Evangeline," I said.</p>

    <p>She made no reply.</p>

    <p>Suddenly a splendid scheme occurred to me. I would teach
    Evangeline her word now. How it would surprise the others when
    they came down and said "Hallo" to her, to find themselves
    promptly answered back!</p>

    <p>"Evangeline," I said, "listen. Hallo, hallo, hallo, hallo."
    I stopped a moment and went on more slowly.
    "Hallo&mdash;hallo&mdash;hallo."</p>

    <p>It was dull work.</p>

    <p>"Hallo," I said, "hallo&mdash;hallo&mdash;hallo," and then
    very distinctly, "Hal-<i>lo</i>."</p>

    <p>Evangeline looked at me with an utterly bored face.</p>

    <p>"Hallo," I said, "hallo&mdash;hallo."</p>

    <p>She picked up a monkey nut and ate it languidly.</p>

    <p>"Hallo," I went on, "hallo, hallo ... hallo, <i>hallo</i>,
    HALLO, <b>HALLO</b> ... hallo, hallo&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She dropped her nut and roused herself for a moment.</p>

    <p>"Number engaged," she snapped, and took another nut.</p>

    <p>You needn't believe this. The others didn't when I told

    </blockquote>

    <h4>(I.)&mdash;BUYING THE HOTEL.</h4>

    <p>For this game several players are required, who form
    themselves into one or more parties according to numbers. A
    player, preferably a woman, is selected as leader, and should
    possess nerve, coolness, and an authoritative voice. The object
    of the game is to secure (1) The best rooms; (2) Tables with a
    view; (3) The controlling interest in all projects of
    entertainment. It is an important advantage for the leader to
    have stayed in the hotel at least once previously. If she is
    able to announce on arrival, "Here we are as usual!" and to
    greet the proprietor and staff by name, this often gives an
    initial blow exceedingly hard to parry. English visitors have
    been proving very adept at the sport this season, with
    Americans a good second. The German game, on the contrary, is
    slower and less subtle.</p>

    <h4>(II.)&mdash;SPOTTING THE PARSON.</h4>

    <p>An amusing game that has been very popular at many Swiss
    resorts lately, and one that calls for the qualifications of a
    quick brain and a keen eye. The universal adoption of sweaters
    and woollen caps makes the task of the players one of
    considerable difficulty. Envelope-reading should be forbidden
    by the rules, and some codes even debar the offering of a
    <i>Church Times</i> to a suspected stranger. The
    <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> and <i>Spectator</i> may, however, be
    freely employed as bait. A simpler version of the same sport
    called "HOW MANY SCHOOLMASTERS?" is often indulged in between
    December 20th and January 15th, after which latter date it
    loses its point.</p>

    <p>Other games, seldom chronicled but inquiring at least as
    much skill from their votaries as the better known varieties,
    are EARLY MORNING SKI-BAGGING&mdash;at which the Germans
    frequently carry all before them&mdash;and PRESSING THE
    PRESS-PHOTOGRAPHER, where the object of all the players is to
    appear recognizably in a snap-shot for the illustrated
    journals. At this the record score of three weekly and five
    daily papers has been held for two successive seasons by the
    same player, a gentleman whose dexterity is the subject of
    universal admiration.</p>

    <h2>THE WONDER ZOO.</h2>

    <p>Canada has evolved a novelty described as a "new beef
    animal," which is a blend of the domestic cow and the North
    American bison. The resulting prodigy has the ferocious hump
    and shoulders of the bison, with the mildly benevolent face of
    the Herefordshire ox. It must not, however, be supposed that
    the old country is behind-hand in such experiments, as witness
    the following:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Billingsgate salesmen have lately been supplied with advance
    copies of the new Codoyster fish. This epicurean triumph, which
    owes its existence to the research of several eminent
    specialists, is the result of a blend of the North Sea cod and
    the finest Whitstable native. The result is said to reproduce
    in a remarkable degree the succulent qualities of the original
    fish when eaten with oyster sauce, and caterers are sure to
    welcome the combination of these popular items in so handy a
    form.</p>

    <p>Several fine examples of the Soho chicken have lately
    appeared upon the show benches at various important poultry
    contests. This ingenious creation, which has long been familiar
    to the patrons of our less expensive restaurants (hence the
    name), is said to possess qualities of endurance superior to
    anything previously on the market. Its muscular development is
    phenomenal, while the entire elimination of the liver, and the
    substitution of four extra drum-sticks for the ordinary wings
    and thighs, are noteworthy characteristics.</p>

    <p>Success in another branch of the same endeavour is shown in
    the latest report of the Society for the Prolongation of
    Dachshunds. According to this the worm-ideal seems at last to
    be in sight, careful inter-breeding having now produced a
    variety called the Processional, selected specimens of which
    take from one to two minutes in passing any given spot. The
    almost entire disappearance of legs is another attractive
    feature.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Major-Gen. Threebottle writes from Oporto Lodge,
    Ealing, strongly protesting against any further complication of
    the fauna of these islands, and pointing out that the simple
    snakes and cats of our youth were already sufficiently
    formidable to a nervous invalid like himself without the
    addition of such objectionable novelties.</p>

    <p>Directly I saw him I was conscious of a feeling of

    salary for it. If I wasn't funny I shouldn't draw a good
    salary, should I?"</p>

    <p>"You do draw it," I said guardedly. "Be funny now."</p>

    <p>"'Wait till I catch you bending,'" he said with a violent
    grimace. "'What ho! 'Ave a drop of gin, ole dear?'"</p>

    <p>"Be funny now," I repeated.</p>

    <p>He looked bewildered. "I <i>was</i> being funny," he said.
    "I bring the house down with that, as a rule."</p>

    <p>"Where?"</p>

    <p>"In panto," he said.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" I replied. "So you're the funny man of a pantomime,
    are you?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said.</p>

    <p>"Which one?"</p>

    <p>"All of them," he said.</p>

    <p>"Good," I replied. "I have long wanted a talk with you.
    There are things I want to ask you. Why, for instance, do you
    always pretend to be a grimy slum woman?"</p>

    <p>"It seems to be expected," he said.</p>

    <p>"Who expects it? The children?"</p>

    <p>"What children?"</p>

    <p>"The children who go to pantomimes," I said.</p>

    <p>"Oh, those! Well, they laugh," he replied evasively.</p>

    <p>"They like to see you quarrelling with your husband and
    getting drunk?"</p>

    <p>"They laugh," he said.</p>

    <p>"They like to hear you, as an Ugly Sister in
    <i>Cinderella</i>, singing 'Father's on the booze again;
    mother's off her chump'?"</p>

    <p>"They laugh," he said.</p>

    <p>"They like to see you as the wife of Ali Baba, finding
    pawntickets in your husband's pockets and charging him with
    spending his money on flappers?"</p>

    <p>"They laugh," he said.</p>

    <p>"They like to see you, as The Widow Twankay, visit a race
    meeting and get welshed and have your clothes torn off?"</p>

    <p>"They laugh," he said.</p>

    <p>"They like to see you, as Dick Whittington's mother, telling
    the cat that, if he must eat onions, at any rate he can refrain
    from kissing her?"</p>

    <p>"They laugh," he said.</p>

    <p>"They like to see you, as the dame in <i>Goody Two
    Shoes</i>, open a night club on the strict understanding that
    it is only for clergymen's daughters in need of
    recreation?"</p>

    <p>"They laugh," he said again.</p>

    <p>"But they don't know what you mean?"</p>

    <p>"No. But I'm funny. That's what you don't seem to
    understand. I'm so funny that everything I say and do makes
    them laugh. It doesn't, in fact, matter <i>what</i> I say."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" I replied, "I have you there! In that case why don't
    you say a few simpler and sweeter things?"</p>

    <p>He seemed perplexed.</p>

    <p>"Things," I explained, "that don't want quite so much
    knowledge of the seamy side of life?"</p>

    <p>"Go on!" he said derisively. "I haven't got time to mug
    <i>that</i> up. I've got my living to get. You don't suppose I
    invent my jokes, do you? I collect them. I'm on the Halls the
    rest of the year, and I hear them there. There hasn't been a
    new joke in a pantomime these twenty years. But what you don't
    seem to get into your head, mister, is the fact that I make
    them laugh. Laugh. I'm a scream, I tell you."</p>

    <p>"And laughter is all you want?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"I must either make people laugh or get 'the bird.'"</p>

    <p>"But hasn't it ever occurred to you," I said, "that children
    in a theatre at Christmas time are entitled to have a little
    fun that is not wholly connected with sordid domestic affairs
    and pothouse commonness?"</p>

    <p>"Never," he said, and I believed him.</p>

    <p>"Haven't you children of your own?"</p>

    <p>"Several."</p>

    <p>"And is that how you amuse them at home?"</p>

    <p>"Of course not. They're too young."</p>

    <p>"How old are they?"</p>

    <p>"From six to thirteen."</p>

    <p>"But that's the age of the children who go to pantomimes," I
    suggested.</p>

    <p>"Well, it's different in your own home," he said. "Besides,"
    he added, "it isn't children I aim at in my jokes. There's
    other things for them: the fairy ballets, the comic dog."</p>

    <p>"And what is the audience you aim at?" I asked. "I suppose
    there is one definite figure you have in your mind's eye?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said, "there is one. The person in the audience
    that I always aim at is the silly servant-girl in the front row
    of the gallery. That's why I so often say 'girls' before I make
    a joke. You've heard me, haven't you?"</p>

    <p>"Haven't I?" I groaned.</p>

    <h2>THE GAME LICENCE.</h2>

    <p>It was yesterday afternoon, towards the close of the last
    beat of our annual cover shoot, that I perceived a fellow in a
    yellow waterproof popping up his head from time to time (at no
    little risk to his life) over a dyke some way behind the line
    of guns. As soon as the beaters came out he advanced and
    introduced himself as an Excise Officer, asking "if this would
    be a convenient moment to examine the game licences of the
    party."</p>

    <p>It was not at all a convenient moment for Walter&mdash;who
    hadn't got one. My thoughts flew at once to Walter in this
    crisis, for I knew he was bound to be had. Walter never does
    have game licences, season tickets, adhesive labels, telegraph
    forms or things of that sort. And as he had only returned from
    Canada two days before and this was the first time that he had
    been out, and further as he immediately disappeared and hid
    behind the hedge, I knew that my worst suspicions must be
    confirmed. While the Excise Officer was taking down the names
    and addresses of the rest of the party I went after Walter. He
    was sitting in the ditch with his head in his hands.</p>

    <p>"If this had happened a few years ago, old chap," he said,
    "when I was a younger man, I should have run for it. But to-day
    I believe that feller would overhaul me within half-a-mile. My
    wind's rotten. Do you think he'll find us here?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," said I, "he is coming this way."</p>

    <p>Walter got up. "There must be some way out of it," he said
    thoughtfully, "if one could only think of it." Then he boldly
    confronted his accuser.</p>

    <p>"Since you put it to me," he said, "no, I have no game
    licence. But fortunately in my case it is not necessary. I am
    exempt."</p>

    <p>The Officer stared at him a moment.</p>

    <p>"Certainly it is necessary," he said.</p>

    <p>"Kindly show me the form of this licence," said Walter in
    the most lordly, off-hand, <i>de-haut-en-bas</i> tone of voice,
    and the Officer handed him one belonging to the Major, which he
    had been scrutinizing. "This, I perceive," said Walter, when he
    had read it carefully, "is a licence or certificate to kill
    game. It doesn't apply to me."</p>

    <p>"Why not?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>

    <p>"Because I haven't killed any game."</p>

    <p>"But you have your gun in your hand at this moment."</p>

    <p>"That is so. This is my gun. But where, I ask you, is my
    dead game? The truth is, my dear fellow," he went on, dropping
    his voice to a more confidential level, "though it's pretty
    humiliating to have to admit it and all that, especially before
    the beaters&mdash;the truth is that I haven't hit a blamed
    thing to-day. Rotten, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>Walter isn't much of a shot and there weren't many birds
    anyway, and he hadn't been very lucky in his stands&mdash;and
    when one came to think it over one couldn't just exactly
    <i>remember</i> anything at all having fallen to his gun.</p>

    <p>"I call all these fellows to witness," said Walter most
    impressively, "that I have killed no game. If it pleases me to
    discharge my gun, at short intervals, for the sake of the
    bang&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You require a gun licence," said the Officer.</p>

    <p>"That is not the point. I may or may not have a gun licence,
    but our present controversy relates to a certificate to kill
    game. Do not let us confuse the issue."</p>

    <p>It now appeared, however, that the Officer had been waiting
    behind the dyke rather longer than we knew. "I myself," he said
    firmly, "saw you bring down a cock pheasant at the beginning of
    the last beat."</p>

    <p>Walter consulted the paper in his hand. "I observe," he
    said, "that this licence (or certificate) relates to killing
    game. There is nothing said of bringing it down. I may, as you
    say, have induced a cock pheasant to descend. I certainly
    didn't kill him. As a matter of fact he was lightly touched on
    the wing, and he ran like a hare."</p>

    <p>"He's in that patch of bracken there," said the Officer. "If
    you will send a keeper and a dog with me&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No, I can't do that," said Walter, "unless you can show me
    a written authority empowering you, in the KING's name, to
    borrow keepers and dogs."</p>

    <p>It was then that the fun began. The Officer went off like a
    shot up the hillside, started the old cock, chased him up the
    ditch and through the hedge, and finally, to everyone's
    surprise and delight, collared him in a corner of the dyke.
    There were loud cheers from the enthusiastic crowd, but they
    were cut short by a sharp warning from Walter.</p>

    <p>"Be careful how you handle that bird, Sir!" he cried. "If
    anything happens to him I shall hold you responsible. I have no
    reason to believe that you hold a licence (or certificate) to
    kill game. If he suffers a mortal injury I shall report
    you."</p>

    <p>The Officer began to look rather bewildered and the old cock
    flapped his wings.</p>

    <p>"I'll thank you for that bird," said Walter firmly, and he
    took it and tucked it comfortably under his arm.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do with it?" asked the Officer.</p>

    <p>"I am going to nurse it back to health and strength," said
    Walter. "It only requires a little close attention. I shall be
    happy if you will call in about a week's time to enquire. Good
    afternoon. I am very pleased to have met you." And Walter held
    out his hand.</p>

    <p>Well, that is where the matter rests. If Walter can keep the
    bird alive the case against him falls to the ground. If not, I
    suppose it means a three-pound licence and a ten-pound fine. He
    took him straight back to the Home Farm and secured for him dry
    and airy quarters in the poultry run, and did not leave him
    till he had seen to his comfort in every way and given minute
    directions as to his treatment....</p>

    <p>I am afraid the old cock passed a rather restless night, but
    he was able to take part of a warm mash, with two drops of
    laudanum in it, at an early hour this morning. At this moment I
    hear Walter getting out his motor-bicycle. I fancy he is going
    for the vet.</p>

    <h2>OLD FRIENDS.</h2>

    <p>I was in the train because I had to go to Birmingham; I was
    in the dining car because I had to dine. With all respect to
    the Company I cannot pretend that I regarded myself as doing
    anything remarkable or distinguished. The little man opposite
    me, however, felt differently. I have since been told that they
    of Birmingham are very proud of their non-stop train service by
    both routes.</p>

    <p>"This, Sir," said the stranger, as I lowered my paper to
    help myself to a proffered roll&mdash;"this is one of the
    Two-Hour trains."</p>

    <p>"You don't say," said I politely but not encouragingly.</p>

    <p>"Two hours," he repeated impressively.</p>

    <p>"Indeed? Two whole hours and not a moment less?" and I
    returned to my paper pending the soup's arrival.</p>

    <p>"Is it not wonderful," he resumed when I was at his mercy
    again, "to be travelling at sixty miles an hour and eating soup
    at the same time?"</p>

    <p>"Some people eat soup," said I, "and some drink it. For
    myself, I give it a miss;" and I returned to the news.</p>

    <p>With the fish: "I came up by the breakfast train this
    morning," said he, "and I now return by the dining train." He
    meant by this to give credit to the Company rather than to
    himself, but even so it seemed to fall short of the complete
    ideal. There was something wanting. It was luncheon, of
    course.</p>

    <p>"They run luncheon cars too," said he.</p>

    <p>"Then there seems to be no reason why you should ever leave
    the train at all," I remarked, seeking refuge again in my
    paper. In spite, however, of my coldness, he continued to
    assail me with similar facts every time I emerged. Finally he
    took a sheet of slightly soiled paper and pencilled on it a
    schedule of our movements. It ran:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"To give this the very careful consideration it deserves,"
    said I, "I must be left absolutely to myself."</p>

    <p>Later on, feeling that I had perhaps been rude, I offered
    the man a cigar by way of compensation. He accepted it as a
    mark of esteem and burst forth into more conversation. By now a
    little fed up with trains himself he suggested, for the sake of
    something new to say, that he had met me before somewhere. At
    first I had some idea of asking for my cigar to be returned,
    but instead I gave in to his persistence. More, I joined in the
    conversation with an energy which surprised him.</p>

    <p>"Now I come to think of it we <i>have</i> seen each other
    before; but where?" I said.</p>

    <p>He thought promiscuously, disconnectedly and aloud. I could
    accept none of his suggestions because all referred to
    commercial rooms in provincial hotels, places to which I have
    not the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>. "But I know now," I declared
    brightly; "it was at a place just this side of London that I
    saw you first."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"

    <p>"First?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes," said I. "I have seen you more than once. Surely
    you haven't forgotten that time at Watford?"</p>

    <p>He felt that I had the advantage of him. "When was that?" he
    asked.</p>

    <p>"Not very long after the first time; and the next occasion I
    remember seeing you was at a place
    called&mdash;called&mdash;something beginning with a B."</p>

    <p>He was quite unable to cope with the situation.</p>

    <p>"And the next time," I continued, "I happened to be passing
    through that town where the school is&mdash;you know, Rugby. I
    distinctly recollect noticing then that you hadn't changed in
    the least since I last saw you."</p>

    <p>He couldn't decide whether to be more flattered at my
    remembering or more annoyed at his own forgetting.</p>

    <p>"Come, come," I exclaimed, "you surely cannot have forgotten

    <p>"Nor have I, ever," said I.</p>

    <p>I could understand his feelings thoroughly. It might be that
    I was a liar; it might be that I was a lunatic. In either case
    he did not wish to converse further with me. Happily, I had two
    newspapers available.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>As the speed of our train, in which of old he had taken such
    a pride, began to slacken: "And I shouldn't be surprised," I
    said from behind my paper, "if you and I saw each other again
    quite soon. The world is a small place and these things soon
    develop into a habit."</p>

    <p>He made no answer from behind his paper.</p>

    <p>"If you ask me when and where" (as in fact he didn't), "I
    should say it is just as likely as not to happen at Birmingham
    at about 8.55 P.M.," I estimated, relying upon his own
    schedule.</p>

    <h2>THE MARRIED MAN'S ADVANTAGE.</h2>

    <p>Personally I think too much respect is paid to age. There is
    nothing clever in being old&mdash;nothing at all. On the other
    hand, youth has a charm of its own. Besides, twenty-two is not
    young; you wouldn't think me so if you really knew me. The
    doubt arises, I suppose, from a certain innate
    light-heartedness. It is really rather pathetic.</p>

    <p>Daphne chooses to see humour in the situation, which is very
    absurd of her, and, as I point out, merely reflects on herself.
    Surely she doesn't wish to admit that it is foolish to love
    her.</p>

    <p>And that, to make a clean breast of it, is exactly what I
    do, and do madly.</p>

    <p>I follow her about, reverently watching her every movement,
    hanging on her every word&mdash;no light task. And my reward? A
    scant unceremonious "Hallo!" when we meet; a scanter "Night" or
    "Morning," according to the circumstances, when we part. A
    brave smile from me and she is gone, an unwitting spectator of
    a real tragedy.</p>

    <p>Up to a few days ago I was content to bear with my lot, but
    last week I rebelled. It was at a dance, after supper. Daphne
    had certainly shown a sort of affection for me, motherly rather
    than otherwise, I think; nevertheless an affection. But then,
    and not for the first time, I had seen her flirting with
    another.</p>

    <p>I decided to lose my temper. I went into the smoke-room and
    deliberated very close to the fire. In five minutes I left the
    room heated.</p>

    <p>I found Daphne at once.</p>

    <p>"Our dance," I said. "We will sit out."</p>

    <p>My manner must have been rather terrifying. At any rate we
    sat out.</p>

    <p>"Daphne," I began, "I am in a mood that brooks no trifling.
    For weeks I have loved you. You spurn me."</p>

    <p>"Oh, Billy, do be sensible," Daphne murmured.</p>

    <p>I moderated my tone. "Well, look here," I said, "why are you
    so cold to me and yet flirt with my cousin? I saw you putting
    his tie straight and patting his arm just now; and you won't
    let me even hold your hand. It's pretty hard, Daphne."</p>

    <p>She laughed. "My dear Billy&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Many thanks for yours of yesterday. I am having a very good
    time and it is really kind of me to write."</p>

    <p>"If you won't be sensible&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I am. It's just because I'm so serious that I jest. All the
    wittiest men are broken-hearted. Go on."</p>

    <p>"Well, my dear Billy, you mustn't be foolish. I'm very fond
    of you, but you're so ridiculously young."</p>

    <p>"You haven't a revolver about you?" I enquired.</p>

    <p>Daphne sighed. "Billy, you're quite hopeless. Do let me try
    to explain. You see, I can't&mdash;well&mdash;flirt with you,
    because I don't really flirt, of course, and besides your
    cousin's different&mdash;he's married."</p>

    <p>I got up quickly. "Good-bye," I said. "You must excuse my
    leaving you."</p>

    <p>Daphne looked surprised. "Where are you going?" she
    enquired.</p>

    <p>"To get married." I walked away with my head in the air.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A week later I wrote Daphne a letter. It ran as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"MY DEAR DAPHNE,&mdash;I am going to get married. Tina
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> is nineteen, the same as you,
       and is in the chorus of a musical comedy. She has real jet
       black hair, so I am quite lucky. I hope you are fonder of me
       already.</p>

    <p>Yours devotedly, BILLY."</p>

    <p>In reply, and by return of post, I received an invitation to
    tea at Daphne's. Daphne, looking beautiful, was awaiting
    me.</p>

    <p>"How d'you do?" I said gravely.</p>

    <p>"Billy," Daphne began, "will you be really serious with
    me?"</p>

    <p>I immediately assumed a business manner and coughed.</p>

    <p>"Well?" I said.</p>

    <p>The word was sharp and incisive, a regular lawyer's
    question.</p>

    <p>"Of course, you're joking about this chorus girl?"</p>

    <p>"Joking! Daphne, you know I'd do anything for you."</p>

    <p>Daphne smiled. "But, Billy, I shan't like you any better if
    you marry her."</p>

    <p>I bit a piece of cake coldly. "I don't understand you,
    Daphne," I said. "When I ask you to show me a little affection,
    only just what you show others, you tell me I'm young and
    married men are different. I arrange to be different at
    considerable personal sacrifice, and you tell me you won't like
    me any better." I swallowed convulsively.</p>

    <p>"But, Billy&mdash;dear&mdash;you're not actually
    engaged?"</p>

    <p>"I'm not so sure," I replied. "These girls are wonderfully
    sharp; and then, of course, I'm so young." (A good touch.)</p>

    <p>There was a silence.</p>

    <p>"I shall hate you if you marry a chorus girl," said
    Daphne.</p>

    <p>"Then why did you tell me married men were different?"</p>

    <p>"Because most of them are." Daphne smiled slowly. "I think I
    might like you better if you were married to some really nice
    girl."</p>

    <p>I laughed bitterly. "To you, for instance?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, to me," said Daphne very sweetly.</p>

    <p>29<i>th December</i>, 1913.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR HUGH.&mdash;Thank you <i>very, very</i> much for the
    sweet little butterdish. It's ripping. Do try to get down,
    Hugh, there's a good boy! If you can find time to choose me
    such a nice present&mdash;I know what you are, it must have
    taken you hours&mdash;surely you could take the day off for
    once. Say yes.</p>

    <p>In tremendous haste, and thanking you again and again,</p>

    <p>Your affectionate cousin,</p>

    <p>MURIEL.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;I've just heard that Mr. Parsley, who is to marry
    us, is very strict about <i>obedient</i> weddings, and I
    promised Geraldine I wouldn't "obey" if she didn't. Now it's my
    turn. Tell me something to do.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>30<i>th December,</i> 1913.</p>

    <p>MY GOOD MURIEL,&mdash;That's a caviare dish! Caviare dishes,
    I understood, were all the rage just now, and here am I slaving
    away to be in the fashion, and you calmly write back and say,
    "Thank you very much for the butt&mdash;" My good Muriel!</p>

    <p>I really wanted to send you something quite different,
    something equally novel but more seasonable; no less, in fact,
    than a nose-muff or nose-warmer. It is a little idea of my own,
    the Melbrook "Rhinotherm." Briefly, the mechanism consists of
    pieces of heated charcoal, potato or what-not, encased in some
    non-conducting material, the whole being then unostentatiously
    affixed to the frigid end of the nose. Stupidly, I forgot to
    take a plaster cast of your nose. You'll forgive me, won't
    you?</p>

    <p>And now about coming down on the happy day. I feel very hurt
    about it. You know perfectly well that I wanted you to be
    married on a Saturday, but you wouldn't. It isn't as though you
    get married every day, and I do think you might have considered
    me a little more. But, even if I did come, even if by working
    all night Monday and Tuesday I could scrape together a few
    hours of freedom, I know what it would be. I should never be
    allowed in the vestry afterwards, while all the fun was going
    on. And yet you have the effrontery to sit there and ask my
    help in evading your, responsibilities as a married woman.
    Still, if you promise to breathe not a word of this to any
    woman I may marry hereafter, here's a dead snip for you.
    Listen! When you come to the words "to love, cherish and to
    obey," you simply drop the second "to" (nobody will miss it)
    and run the "d" of the "and" into the "obey," and lo! we have a
    French word, to wit, <i>dauber</i>, meaning to cuff, drub or
    belabour. What say you to that, my bonny bride? I think that
    deserves an extra large slice of cake, to put under my pillow.
    And I say, Muriel, I do hope there won't be any of those rotten
    cassowary seeds in it. If there are, for pity's sake rake them
    out and give them to someone who likes them. And I'll have his
    share of the marzipan.</p>

    <h4>NEWSPAPER EXCERPT.</h4>

    <p>... During the service an amusing incident occurred. It was
    noticed that the, bride, who is rumoured to have feminist
    leanings, betrayed some difficulty in pronouncing the vow of
    obedience. The Rev. Thos. Parsley considerately paused and
    helped her to repeat the words after him in a clear and audible
    manner. In an interview with our representative, Mr. Parsley
    smilingly explained that he was determined, in his parish at
    any rate, to discourage any possible evasion of the matrimonial
    vows. He considered that a great deal of post-nuptial
    unhappiness was attributable to the lamentable laxity of the
    clergy in joining young people in matrimony without requiring
    their future relations to be clearly defined at the outset. The
    young bride refused to make any comment, but seemed highly
    amused at the incident....</p>

    <h2>THE COWARD.</h2>

    <p>It is impossible to describe to you exactly how Herbert
    looked. But shame, defiance and unconcern were the principal
    ingredients in his expression as he stood on the kerb and
    stared across the road.</p>

    <p>He started guiltily as I approached.</p>

    <p>"Hallo, Herbert!" I began with my customary
    <i>bonhomie</i>.</p>

    <p>"Hallo!" he said dismally.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing here?" I asked sternly.</p>

    <p>"Nothing," said Herbert. "Have you ever noticed what a fine
    building that post-office is?"</p>

    <p>"No," I said; "neither have you. Herbert, you are concealing
    something from me. What have I done to deserve it? Have I not
    enjoyed your confidence these many years, and have you ever
    known me betray it? Is it marriage that has changed you thus?
    Is it&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Shut up," said Herbert. "I'll tell you, if you stop
    talking."</p>

    <p>I stopped talking.</p>

    <p>"It's this way. My wife and I have had a little discussion.
    And I stated my belief that there was nothing in an ordinary
    way that a woman could do that a man couldn't. Whereupon she
    defied me to go out and&mdash;er&mdash;buy a bloater. As you
    see, I have gone out, and&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "you have gone out. Splendid of you! And all
    that remains to be done is to buy a bloater. Why not? Yonder,
    if I mistake not, is the shop of a bloaterer."</p>

    <p>"But a bloater!" said Herbert. "It isn't fair. If she'd said
    some salmon, or a lobster, or even a pound of sausages; or if
    she'd allowed me to 'phone for it. It's not as if I'd ever had
    any practice. It's not decent to start a beginner on a
    hand-bought bloater."</p>

    <p>"Tush!" I said. "This is not manly. Remember, our sex is at
    stake. Come!"</p>

    <p>I took him by the arm. He advanced under protest.</p>

    <p>Four paces from the shop he stopped abruptly and
    laughed&mdash;a horrible laugh.</p>

    <p>"Do you know," he said, "I do believe I've come out without
    a cent on me."</p>

    <p>"<i>I</i> don't believe it for a moment," I said, "but as it
    happens I can lend you pounds and pounds&mdash;almost enough
    for two bloaters."</p>

    <p>Herbert reluctantly found some money in one of the seven
    pockets he had not felt in. Then we advanced once more.</p>

    <p>This time there was no going back. Right into the body of
    the fishmonger's we strode and stood firmly opposite the
    salesman.</p>

    <p>"<i>Now</i>," I whispered tensely.</p>

    <p>But Herbert hesitated, and even as he wobbled the salesman
    began his suggestions.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir? Lobsters or prawns, Sir? Some very good salmon
    this morning&mdash;very fine fish indeed, Sir."</p>

    <p>"Er, as a matter of fact," said Herbert, "we just wanted to
    know if you would be so kind as to direct us to the nearest
    post-office?&mdash;the one just across the road, you know," he
    added nervously.</p>

    <p>"Herbert," I said in his private ear, "be a man."</p>

    <p>Herbert pulled himself together. "Would you," he said to the
    salesman, "would you please let me look at some
    b-b-blobsters?"</p>

    <h2>A BAD DREAM.</h2>

    <p><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;Great news! The plan suggested by the
    Anglo-German Alliance Committee is at last to be carried out.
    There is to be an exchange of garrisons, that is to say,
    certain English towns are to be garrisoned by German regiments,
    while certain German towns are to have English garrisons. Our
    own town, though a small one, is to have the distinguished
    honour of being the first to give this mark of friendship to
    the world. All the arrangements have been made, and to-morrow
    the 901st Prussian regiment of infantry is to march in. It will
    be a great day for Dartlebury, and we shall all do our best,
    though the public notice has been short, to give our gallant
    visitors a warm and truly British reception.</p>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;Our German friends have arrived. At 11
    o'clock this morning it was announced that they were
    approaching, headed by their band. The Mayor, Alderman
    Farthingale, and the whole Corporation, including the three
    Labour members recently elected, immediately proceeded to the
    old city wall to meet them. They were accompanied by the
    municipal band in full uniform, playing "<i>Die Wacht am
    Rhein</i>," which they had been assiduously practising.
    Unfortunately this led to what might have been a somewhat
    painful contretemps. On meeting the municipal band the Prussian
    commander, Colonel von Brausebrum, halted his soldiers and in a
    loud voice declared that our men were playing out of tune.
    Perhaps this was true, but the offence was involuntary and in
    any case it was hardly serious enough to call for the arrest of
    the whole band. Arrested, however, they were, and it was a
    melancholy sight to see them marched off by a corporal's guard.
    Mr. Zundnadel, the chief of the band, is himself of German
    origin, and his feelings can be better imagined than described.
    The Mayor saved the situation by making an extremely cordial
    speech, in which he spoke of the English and the Germans as
    ancient brothers-in-arms. The Colonel in his reply said his
    mission was a glorious one, and everything would depend on the
    way we conducted ourselves. What can he have meant? The march
    was then resumed, but another halt was made in the High Street
    to remove the French flag which Mucklow, the linen-draper, had
    very tactlessly stuck up over his shop. He too was arrested,
    with wife and family, and was lodged in jail. Luckily no
    further incident disturbed the harmony of the proceedings.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;This morning Lieutenant von
    Schornstein, while walking in Brewer's Alley, trod on a piece
    of banana-skin and fell heavily on the pavement. As he rose he
    observed that two small boys were, so he alleged, laughing at
    him. He immediately ran after the two urchins, and was
    proceeding to put them to the sword when the Brewery men
    interfered and disarmed him. He pleaded that his uniform had
    been insulted and that it was necessary for him to punish them.
    "<i>Ich muss sie durch den Leib rennen</i>" were his words. The
    men, however, were not inclined to admit the force of this
    plea, especially as they understood no German, and they sent
    him back to barracks in a taxi-cab. The Mayor at once wired his
    apologies to the Colonel, and it is hoped that nothing further
    will be heard of the incident. I ought to add that the boys
    deny that they laughed, but the lieutenant is certain that they
    wore a smiling expression.</p>

    <p>The "Friendship Banquet" was held this evening in the Town
    Hall, with the Mayor in the chair. No very great enthusiasm was
    shown, and when the Mayor, in proposing the health of our
    visitors, alluded to the friendly rivalry of the two nations in
    commerce and the arts of peace, the Colonel pulled him back
    into his seat and begged him not to proceed. "<i>Maul
    halten</i>," he said. The three Labour members of the Council
    were afterwards arrested for not having joined with sufficient
    heartiness in the singing of "<i>Deutschland &uuml;ber
    Alles</i>."</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;A state of siege has been declared
    in Dartlebury, and we are all living under martial law. Lord
    Gruffen was arrested for having knocked up against a soldier.
    The magistrates, on leaving the police-court, were handcuffed
    and removed to barracks. A crisis is evidently approaching.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;An insurrection started this morning.
    A huge crowd attacked the barracks and overpowered all
    resistance. Blood flowed like water, but in an hour all was
    over. There is a strong feeling that the experiment of the
    Alliance Committee was a rash one, though no doubt it was well
    meant. We live and learn.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Just as one may say of certain novelists that they write at
    the top of their voices, so, I think, one might describe Miss
    VIOLA MEYNELL as writing in a whisper. This certainly is the
    effect that <i>Modern Lovers</i> (SECKER) produced upon me. The
    gentle method of it invested the story&mdash;which of itself is
    a very slight thing&mdash;with an odd significance almost
    impossible to communicate in criticism; but the reading of a
    few pages will show you what I mean. The title is apt enough,
    for the tale is about nothing but love, as it affects a group
    of five young people, three men and two girls. Of the girls,
    who are sisters, <i>Effie Rutherglen</i> is the more important
    and detailed figure. <i>Effie</i>, in the time before the story
    opens, had an affair with <i>Oliver Bligh</i>; then, summoned
    North to live with her futile and uncomprehending parents, she
    fell (as did her sister <i>Milly</i> and most of the local
    spinsters) under the fascination of one <i>Clive Maxwell</i>,
    who was an author and had appealing eyes and obviously a way
    with him. Then <i>Oliver</i> turned up again, and poor
    <i>Effie</i> didn't know which of them she wanted. I speak
    lightly, but, if you think all this made for comedy, your
    conception of Miss MEYNELL's methods is very much at fault.
    Love to her is very much what it was to <i>Patience</i> in the
    opera&mdash;by no means a wholly enviable boon. I can hardly
    praise too much the exquisite refinement and restraint of her
    treatment of commonplace things. But one small point baffled
    me: <i>Oliver</i> appears to have been a professional diver and
    bath-keeper&mdash;we are told, indeed, that he had occupied
    that position at Rugby (a statement that I have private and
    personal reasons for discrediting)&mdash;yet we find him
    staying as a welcome and honoured guest in the house of the
    <i>Rutherglens</i>, whom I take to be more or less "county."
    Surely this, though of no real importance, is at least
    remarkable?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"What," I asked myself, "is just the matter with this
    apparently quite nice book?" (It was <i>Joan's Green Year</i>,
    and written by E.L. DOON and published by MACMILLAN.) It is the
    kind of book that grows out of a romantic disposition and an
    assiduously stuffed commonplace book. It consists of letters
    from <i>Joan</i>, a paying guest in the Manor House Farm at
    Pelton, to her brother <i>Keith</i>, a soldier in India,
    telling him all about her year of holiday and "soul discipline"
    in the country, the village gossip, her proposals and her one
    acceptance, and giving a sort of farmer's calendar of the
    seasons as interpreted by the guileless amateur. <i>Joan</i>
    has what is known as a nice mind. But to tell truth she has
    chosen a difficult and dangerous if alluring art form. Of
    course letters enable you to evade some of the difficulties of
    the novelist's task, to be discursive, allusive and incomplete.
    But you can't be let off anything of the precision and subtlety
    of your characterisation. On the contrary. And <i>Joan</i>
    makes everyone in Pelton (except the rustics, whose
    authenticity I gravely suspect) talk as <i>Joan</i> writes.
    They have nearly all seen her commonplace book, I judge. Then,
    again, you must not have (like <i>Joan</i>) a large list of
    acquaintances, or you breed confusion and dissipate interest
    accordingly. <i>Joan</i> is very young in many ways. She is
    extravagant in the matter of the equipment of her heroes.
    <i>Bob Ingleby</i>, the farmer (a gentleman, because he had
    been at Winchester), is a "great comely giant," yet wins events
    one and three of the Hunt Steeplechase, though thrown badly in
    number two. I have a suspicion that this work is really
    <i>Joan's</i> tee shot, and that after a notable recovery,
    which on the best of her present form I can safely prophesy,
    she will reach her green year next time.</p>

    <p>Mrs. T.P. O'CONNOR has written a fascinating book. <i>My
    Beloved South</i> she calls it, and PUTNAMS publish it. There
    is not a lifeless page in the 427 that make up a bountiful
    feast. Every one contains vivid reproductions of incidents in
    social life in the South "befo' de wa'" and after. At the
    outset we make the acquaintance of a typical Southron, Mrs.
    O'CONNOR's grandfather, Governor of Florida when it was still a
    Territory, with native Indians fighting fiercely for their land
    and homes. Mrs. O'CONNOR was, of course, not to the fore in
    those early days. But so steeped is she in lore of the South,
    much of it gained from the lips of nurses and out-door
    servants, so keen is her sympathy, so quick and true her
    instinct that she is able to revivify the old scenes and
    reproduce the atmosphere of the time. The darkey nurse of
    earliest childhood lives again, sometimes bringing with her
    plantation songs like "Voodoo-Bogey-Boo," quaintly musical.
    Many passages of the grandfather's conversations are preserved,
    in which we may detect the voice of the gifted granddaughter.
    But the influence of heredity is strong, more especially "down
    South." Also there are many charming stories redolent of the
    South. I was about to mention the page on which will be found
    the thrilling history of a mule aptly named "Satan." On
    reflection I won't spoil the reader's pleasure in unexpectedly
    coming upon it somewhere about the middle of the book.
    Nobody&mdash;man or woman, girl or boy&mdash;who begins to read
    <i>My Beloved South</i> will skip a page. So the story cannot
    be overlooked.</p>

    <p>In <i>Lost Diaries</i> (DUCKWORTH) Mr. MAURICE BARING
    travels by an easy road to humour, and he does not pound it
    with too laborious feet. This is perhaps a fortunate thing, for
    a farcical reconstruction of history in the light of modern
    sentiment and circumstances might easily tire; a Comic History
    of England, for instance, is stiffer reading to-day than
    GARDNER or GREEN. Sometimes, however, Mr. BARING seems to carry
    to extreme lengths his conscientious avoidance of efforts to be
    funny; and in the imaginary records of one or two of his
    subjects there is little more to laugh at than the unaided
    fancy of the student has long ago perceived. <i>Tristram</i>
    loved two <i>Iseults</i>, and JOHN MILTON was an exasperating
    husband; but these things I knew, and the author of <i>Lost
    Diaries</i> has made no more capital out of the situations than
    the eternal merriment which the bare statement of the facts
    inspires. But where Mr. BARING, pleasantly disdainful alike of
    consistency and taste, examines the pocket-book of the "Man in
    the Iron Mask," and finds him complaining of the noise and
    disturbance in dungeon after dungeon until he is removed at
    last to the lotus island of the Bastille; or records the
    blameless botanical pursuits of TIBERIUS in seclusion; or the
    first consumption of the Colla di Gallo by COLUMBUS in the
    newly discovered West, he is, for all the simplicity of his
    methods, amusing enough. Yet even so I am inclined to think
    that the first of his essays, which reads like an actual
    transcript from the jottings of a nineteenth-century
    private-school boy, is the diary which I most heartily
    congratulate Mr. BARING on having rediscovered, and which I
    should be least willing for him to lose again.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>With the Land Question staring us in the face, <i>Folk of
    the Furrow</i> (SMITH ELDER) should attract the attention of
    those who wish thoroughly to understand what the agricultural
    labourer wants and why he wants it. Mr. CHRISTOPHER HOLDENBY is
    no amateur, for as Mr. STEPHEN REYNOLDS has lived with
    fishermen and shared their daily lives so he has lodged in
    labourers' cottages and hoed and dug with the best (and worst)
    of them. The result is a book that is stamped with the
    hall-mark of a great sincerity; and three facts at least can be
    gathered from it by the very dullest of gleaners. First, and I
    think foremost, that the decencies of life cannot be observed
    if children of very various ages are to be crowded into
    cottages too small to hold them; secondly, that it is useless
    to expect morality from youths who have few or no amusements
    provided for them; thirdly, that the passing of the old
    families and the advent of the week-end "merchant princes" do
    not make a change for the better. All which may be stale news,
    but after reading this book I think that you will admit that
    Mr. HOLDENBY has contrived to make an old tale very impressive.
    In some instances it is true that I could bring evidence
    directly in opposition to his, but on the whole he deserves
    well for the way in which he has won the confidence of a class
    naturally suspicious and silent, and for his manner of stating
    his case. Had I for my sins to cram our M.P.'s for the debates
    that lie before them, I should feed them liberally upon <i>Folk
    of the Furrow</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
